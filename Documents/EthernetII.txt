Ethernet II (From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame)
Ethernet II framing (also known as DIX Ethernet, named after DEC, Intel and Xerox, the major participants in its design[4]), defines the two-octet EtherType field in an Ethernet frame, preceded by destination and source MAC addresses, that identifies an upper layer protocol encapsulating the frame data. For example, an EtherType value of 0x0800 signals that the frame contains an IPv4 datagram. Likewise, an EtherType of 0x0806 indicates an ARP frame, 0x8100 indicates an IEEE 802.1Q frame and 0x86DD indicates an IPv6 frame.
As this industry-developed standard went through a formal IEEE standardization process, the EtherType field was changed to a (data) length field in the new 802.3 standard.[note 6] Since the packet recipient still needs to know how to interpret the packet, the standard required an IEEE 802.2 header to follow the length and specify the packet type. Many years later, the 802.3x-1997 standard, and later versions of the 802.3 standard, formally approved of both types of framing. In practice, both formats are in wide use,[citation needed] with original Ethernet framing the most common in Ethernet local area networks, due to its simplicity and lower overhead.
In order to allow some packets using Ethernet v2 framing and some packets using the original version of 802.3 framing to be used on the same Ethernet segment, EtherType values must be greater than or equal to 1536 (0x0600). That value was chosen because the maximum length of the payload field of an Ethernet 802.3 frame is 1500 octets (0x05DC). Thus if the field's value is greater than or equal to 1536, the frame must be an Ethernet v2 frame, with that field being a type field.[5] If it's less than or equal to 1500, it must be an IEEE 802.3 frame, with that field being a length field. Values between 1500 and 1536, exclusive, are undefined.[6] This convention allows software to determine whether a frame is an Ethernet II frame or an IEEE 802.3 frame, allowing the coexistence of both standards on the same physical medium.

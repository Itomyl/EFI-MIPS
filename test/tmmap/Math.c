Routine Description:

  Support routine for the PE/COFF Loader that reads a buffer from a PE/COFF file

Arguments:

  FileHandle - The handle to the PE/COFF file

  FileOffset - The offset, in bytes, into the file to read

  ReadSize   - The number of bytes to read from the file starting at FileOffset

  Buffer     - A pointer to the buffer to read the data into.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS - ReadSize bytes of data were read into Buffer from the PE/COFF file starting at FileOffset
